0.  BPM - 16million (24 bits), 
    PNG - 256 - 16 million (can be 8 or 24 bits)
    JPEG - 16 milliion (24 bit)
    GIF - 256 (8 bit)
    
1.  Gif supports animation, the rest do not.

2.  lossy formats (jpeg and gif) lose pixels when compression, like taking a photocopy of a photocopy
    lossless formats to not lose pixels during compression.
    
3.  Jpeg and gif

4.  The data, ones and zeros are still there, but the first character is changed which indixates it is deleted.  
    The file location is then moved to the available to be used sector.

5.  Physically destroy the drive, de magnetize, or overwrite the data (not as consistant).  
    Overwriting can involve 
    write null zeros in every location of the hard drive.
    
6.  It is a header file that allows you to specify exact width interger types.

7.  It sets the length of types to specific ints in a fixed width
    i.e. uint8_t = unsigned 8 bit integer.
    
8.  8, 32, 32, 16 bits respectively or 1,4,4,2 bytes.

9.  It is the chars BM, a 2 byte WORD type.

10. bfSize is the size, in bytes, of a bitmap file.
    biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.
    They are both DWORD.
    
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB 
    and its origin is the upper-left corner.
    
12. biBitCount

13. It would do it if couldn't create the output file for whatever reason.

14. I believe the BYTE typedef is defined as 8 bits, or one BYTE, so fread reads 1 byte.

15. Each scanline has the end with a multiple of 4 bytes.   
    So, 3 + 1 = 4.
    
16.  The  fseek()  function  sets the file position indicator for the stream
       pointed to by stream.... It skips the padding in copy.c
       
17.  If whence (3rd argument of fseek) is set to SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, 
        the offset  is  relative  to
       the  start of the file, the current position indicator, or end-of-file.  SEEK_CUR
       therefore sets it relative to the current position indicator.
       
18. It looks a little like TA Rob Bowden, maybe holding a cat?
